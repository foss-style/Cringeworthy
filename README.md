## Checklists

## Example 1: Checklists that are not interactive. AMAZON Re:INVENT 2018 (November 2018, Las Vegas)
...Notes from the Technical Writer... 

I was SO excited to hear that a friend of mine was going to this for work. I saw there was a checklist and was interested in the list. How do you handle this low functioning situation? I have seen a few things in my day, but this was elementary at best. In fact, I really felt as though my time was wasted. A Checklist presented for this event seemed like a great idea!!!
Execution, is another story.



Am I going to print that checklist out? with... a Printer???? Should I use a dot matrix......

Now, I need to find a writing utensil... nooooo (that actually works!!!).

If I want to resize an image do I need to do some wax paste-up?
Come on.

## Basic Recommendation
Interactive recommendation - always. Even better if you can capture the data - when what was checked - when permissible.
Forwarding to another document - I was not ready for this.
Is the PDF, in fact, interactive for Windows users? I'm not sure. Now, I question your consideration for the FOSS community.
Thanks. Thanks... a lot.

## Another Suggestion
Create an app with a checklist and a getText function for notes to redeem yourselves. Offer the link.

`Note: The purpose of this github is to offer content and information related to the FOSS community and culture. I mean, honestly, if I test this link and it works in Windows - that's an entirely other issue.`

## Bad		
The checklist is on the web page and is not interactive. https://reinvent.awsevents.com/info/preparing-for-reinvent/?trk=www.google.com

## Worse		
The checklist links to a Presentation. Not interactive but when you click the checklist, it opens a website. That is not intuitive at all.

## Terrible	
I can't do anything with this... Really.

## Horrible
The people in your organization who are in charge of marketing are somewhat... incompetent in my opinion.
I mean... marketing is the gig, right - Reassign the person who made the checklist. 

Truly disappointed, Amazon. Truly. I was looking forward to a checklist. 
I wonder if someone said - wouldn't it be better if it was interactive? If there is someone like that in your organization, give that person a raise. You can afford it, as soon as you let the other one go.
