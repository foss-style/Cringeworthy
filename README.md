examples of cringeworthy communication to find alternatives, solutions and recommendations

# Examples
## Checklists

## Example 1: Checklists that are not interactive. 
...Notes from the Technical Writer... 
Am I going to print that checklist out? with... a Printer???? Should I use a dot matrix.. 

Now I need to find a writing utensil... nooooo (that works).

"Hello Darkness my old friend..."

If I want to resize an image do I need to do some wax paste-up?
Come on.

## Basic Recommendation
Interactive recommendation - always. Even better if you can capture the data - when what was checked - when permissible.
Forwarding to another document - I was not ready for this.
Is the PDF, in fact, interactive for Windows users? I'm not sure. Now, I question your consideration for the FOSS community.
Thanks. Thanks... a lot.

`Note: The purpose of this github is to offer content and information related to the FOSS community and culture. I mean, honestly, if I test this link and it works in Windows - that's an entirely other issue.`

## Bad		
The checklist is on the web page and is not interactive. https://reinvent.awsevents.com/info/preparing-for-reinvent/?trk=www.google.com

## Worse		The checklist links to a Presentation. Not interactive but when you click the checklist, it opens a website. That is not intuitive at all.

## Terrible	I can't do anything with this... Really.
